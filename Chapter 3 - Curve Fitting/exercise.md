# Exercise: Curve Fitting
> Given data set consists of N+1 points (xi, fi) : i = 0 - N (x and f are 2 column vectors of N+1 elements which are input when running)

#### Q1. 
Write function Interpolation(x, f) to find polynomial p(x) of degree N that fits the given dataset (using Inverted Matrix).
Simulate result by plotting data set and polynomial p(x).

#### Q2. 
Write function Largrange(x, f) to find polynomial p(x) of degree N (using Largrange method) that fits the given dataset.
Simulate result by plotting data set and polynomial p(x).

> Apply to dataset: x = [1:12], f = [54.4; 54.6; 67.1; 78.3; 85.3; 88.7; 96.9; 97.6; 84.1; 80.1; 68.8; 61.1]

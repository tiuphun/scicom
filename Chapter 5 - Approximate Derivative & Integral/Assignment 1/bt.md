Given the function: f(x, y) = x^2\*y - 2\*y^2
The differential of the function: delta.f = (df/dx, df/dy)

**Requirements**: Write a MATLAB script to do the following work:
1. Calculate the derivative of the function f in the domain `-2 <= x <= 2`, `-1 <= y <= 1`, with a grid of points distance h = 0.01 by 2 methods: forward difference (FD) and central difference (CD). Students choose boundary condition, e.g. fix boundary condition.
2. Evaluate the error of each method: Draw a graph to compare the error between the approximate derivative and the exact derivative.
